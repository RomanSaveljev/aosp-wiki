## How is this one different

The information is scattered and some topics are hardly covered at all. Here we try to consolidate the effort paid by others and arrange it in a way suitable for system integrator. So, no [TWRP recoveries](https://twrp.me/), no [ODIN](http://www.droidviews.com/download-odin-tool-for-samsung-galaxy-devices-all-versions/) or any other hacking.

The process is described how it is meant to be followed by Android device creators.

Unlike others, this wiki lives on the [GitHub](https://github.com/RomanSaveljev/aosp-wiki). The pages are prepared with the help of [gollum](https://github.com/gollum/gollum).

## Android vendors

* [Dedicated docker image](android-build-system/docker-image.md)
* [Source code organization](android-build-system/source-code-organization.md)
* [hmm commands](android-build-system/hmm-commands)
