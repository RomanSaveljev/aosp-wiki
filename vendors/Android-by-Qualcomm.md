Qualcomm runs [Android for MSM project](https://www.codeaurora.org/xwiki/bin/QAEP/WebHome) in Code Aurora Forum (CAF).

Your one-stop shop is the [releases](https://www.codeaurora.org/xwiki/bin/QAEP/release) page, where the manifests are listed.

Qualcomm baseline consists of two parts: open-source and proprietary. It should be (in theory) possible to build the images with just the open-source part, because the proprietary stuff comes in blobs. Do not be surprised, though, to catch some build errors, because some proprietary dependency has been left out by mistake.
